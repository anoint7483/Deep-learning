Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning that is inspired by the structure of a human brain.
Deep learning algorithms attempt to draw similar conclusions as humans would by continually analyzing data with a given logical structure called Neural Network.

ANN -> Artificial Neural Network -> Simple
CNN -> Convolutional Neural Network -> Image Data
RNN -> Recurrent Neural Network -> speech/text
GAN -> Generative Adversarial Neural Network -> generate text, images 

Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural network with representation learning.

Deep Learning Algorithms uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For exam, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces.

### Deep Learning Vs Machine Learning

1. Data Dependency: Needs a large amount of data than machine learning.
2. Hardware Dependency: Costly, Need GPU, have matrix multiplications.
3. Training Time: Very high like days and weeks.
4. Feature Selection: have algorithm and do automatic feature selection
5. Interpretability: Interpretability is less in deep learning because it is do not give reason about the prediction.

#### Why it is famous know

-> Datasets: Companies like google and Microsoft(COCO for images) have publicly available data 
-> Hardware: cost of hardware reduces and GPU uses for deep learning research.
-> Frameworks: like Tensorflow+keras from google and pytorch from facebook which help in code management.
-> Architectures: uses existing architecture which uses transfer learning like RESNET for images, BERT for text etc. 
-> Community: know people are conscious about deep learning.
